 * k3.h, Kimi K3 inference engine: public configuration and core types.
 *
 * OVERVIEW
 *   Kimi K3 is a 2.78-trillion-parameter mixture-of-experts model. This engine runs it
 *   on a single CPU by treating memory as a dial rather than a floor:
 *
 *     - the dense trunk (108.81 GB) is either held resident or streamed from disk in a
 *       fixed layer order, so the next read is always known in advance;
 *     - the 1.45 TB of routed experts are never resident. They stream on demand and are
 *       multiplied straight out of their packed MXFP4 form, never widened to fp32.
 *
 * THE THREE WEIGHT FIGURES, since they are easy to confuse
 *   108.81 GB   the 93 per-layer trunk runs, at bf16. Streamable, and re-read IN FULL
 *               on every token, which is why docs/TUNING.md says to feed the trunk
 *               before the expert cache.
 *     4.70 GB   embed and lm_head. Always resident; not part of the streamed trunk.
 *   113.49 GB   the two together: 56,743,648,000 always-active parameters at bf16, the
 *               figure tools/budget.py reports from the shard headers. Doubles to
 *               ~227 GB if anything widens this to fp32, which is why nothing does.
 *   1.45 TB     the routed experts, at MXFP4. Never resident at any budget.
 *
 *   The practical consequence is that the model runs in 8 GB of RAM and in 224 GB, and
 *   produces byte-identical output at both. See docs/PERFORMANCE.md.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE (all values verified against the released config.json)
 *   93 layers: 69 Kimi Delta Attention (KDA) + 24 Gated MLA, plus one dense layer.
 *   Hidden 7168, 96 heads, 896 routed experts with top-16 selection and 2 shared,
 *   latent width 3584, SiTU-GLU activation, MXFP4 expert weights.
 *   docs/ARCHITECTURE.md maps each of these onto the technical report.
 *
 * THREE INVARIANTS THAT MUST HOLD
 *   Each of these is a place where a plausible-looking implementation produces a model
 *   that runs, emits fluent text, and is wrong. Each is gated by a fixture in
 *   tests/fixtures/ops chosen so that getting it wrong changes the output, and each is
 *   restated at its point of use.
 *
 *   1. A_log is indexed PER HEAD, not per channel. The checkpoint ships head_dim floats
 *      but only the first num_heads are meaningful; the remainder are padding.
 *      Gated by the kda_decay fixture, whose A_log is a linspace, so a per-channel
 *      misindex moves every element.
 *   2. MLA uses NoPE, yet the 64 rope dimensions still exist and are still cached.
 *      Only the rotation is absent. Dropping the slots changes the head width.
 *      Gated by the mla fixture, which asserts the softmax scale is over the FULL head
 *      width qk_nope + qk_rope, not over qk_nope alone.
 *   3. The MoE routing bias steers SELECTION only. Combining weights come from the
 *      UNBIASED sigmoid scores.
 *      Gated by the router fixture, whose bias reorders the top-k on 5 of its 6 rows.
 *
 * NOT INVARIANTS OF THIS IMPLEMENTATION
 *   Earlier revisions of this header also listed the UT-transform inverse (I + Akk)^-1
 *   and the retention of Aqk's diagonal but not Akk's. Those describe the chunked
 *   parallel form of the delta rule. This engine does not use it: k3_kda_step runs the
 *   naive sequential O(T) recurrence, one position at a time, and so does the reference
 *   in tools/k3_ref.py. Neither matrix is ever formed, so there was nothing to get right
 *   and no test could have caught getting it wrong. They are recorded in
 *   docs/ARCHITECTURE.md as properties of the algorithm, which is where a claim the code
 *   does not make belongs. Anyone adding a chunked KDA path must reinstate them here
 *   together with the fixtures that gate them.
