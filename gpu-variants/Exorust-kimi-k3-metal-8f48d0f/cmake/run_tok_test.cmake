# tiktoken.model has 163,584 entries and ships with the checkpoint, not with this
# repository, so this gate cannot run on a clean checkout. It is registered anyway: a
# check that vanishes from the list when it cannot run reads as "one fewer test to care
# about", and ctest's count silently stops matching what `make test` runs.
#
# K3_TOK_FILES is read here, at TEST time rather than configure time, so
# `K3_TOK_FILES=/path/to/k3model ctest` works without reconfiguring the build.
