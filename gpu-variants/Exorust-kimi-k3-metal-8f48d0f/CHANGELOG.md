## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-07

Verified end to end on the full released checkpoint, and made substantially faster, with
byte-identical output preserved at every step. The first-run experience, which was broken
on a clean clone, now works.

### Added

- **`--preset auto`**: sizes the trunk and expert-cache budgets from the machine's own free
  RAM, trunk-first, so a user need not pick a preset by hand. A gigabyte given to the trunk
  is worth far more than a gigabyte of expert cache, and auto pins accordingly, capping the
  pin below the RAM ceiling after a heavy-pin regression was measured.
- **Chunk-union prefill**: a batched-prefill MoE that fetches each unique routed expert once
  per chunk instead of once per token, measured to read about half the expert bytes on a
  prompt, with the generated token bit-identical to the per-token path.
- **Conversation resume** (`--save-state` / `--load-state`): carries the recurrent state and
  KV cache to disk so a second turn resumes instead of re-reading the whole prompt, measured
  3.9x faster on turn two with identical output. Refuses to restore state from a different
  architecture.
- **`--spec N`**: speculative decode by n-gram drafting with batched greedy verification;
  output is exactly the serial greedy decode by construction.
- `--tf-check`, teacher-forced agreement over an id sequence in one sweep, for measuring
  draft quality; `tools/qdq_trunk.py` and `tools/int8_trunk.py` for deriving quantized
  trunks.

### Changed

- **Fused matmul kernels** (fp32, bf16, MXFP4): sixteen partitioned accumulators with
  explicitly fused products, taking the trunk matmul to its memory floor (about eight times
  less per-token compute) while keeping the scalar and AVX2 paths bitwise identical.
- **KDA recurrence parallelised over heads**, bit-identical to the serial form.
- `scripts/k3-doctor.sh` per-preset speed expectations refreshed to the v1.0.0 numbers, with
  the streaming presets noted as disk-bound and the resident tier as compute-bound.

### Fixed

- All shell scripts are committed executable; the first documented command no longer fails
  with Permission denied on a clean clone.
- `scripts/download-model.sh` uses the current `hf` CLI and pins an immutable revision with
  checksum verification; it no longer attempts a pip install that cannot succeed on the
  target OS, and refuses to start without free space for the checkpoint.
- `scripts/k3-doctor.sh` no longer fails a machine that can build and test the engine; the
  memory floor is a warning about running the checkpoint, not a hard stop.
- The config-refusal fixtures the docs describe now exist and are gated in `make test`,
  ctest and CI; the tokenizer leg reports NOT RUN rather than passing silently; CI runs
  `make test` rather than a hand-picked subset.
- A silent-corruption path in the MLA KV overflow and one in the single-slot trunk reader,
  both of which could emit a plausible wrong token, now abort or are prevented.
- The MXFP4 packer alignment and the tiny-checkpoint scale rule.

### Research notes, not shipped as features

- Lossless trunk compression and a quantized-self-draft hybrid were both built and measured,
  and both turned out to help only narrow regimes. The findings and prototypes are kept in
  [`docs/notes/`](docs/notes/).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-31

First public release.

### Added

- Full 93-layer Kimi K3 inference: 69 KDA + 24 Gated MLA layers, 896 routed experts with
  top-16 selection, SiTU-GLU, Attention Residuals, native MXFP4 expert weights.
- **Trunk streaming**, which turns the memory budget into a dial rather than a floor. The
  model runs in 8 GB and in 224 GB and produces byte-identical output at every budget
  measured in between.
- MXFP4 matmul that consumes packed nibbles directly, never materialising a dequantised
  expert.
- BPE tokenizer in C, reading the released `tiktoken.model` directly, text in, text out
  with no external step.
- Config reader that loads the checkpoint's own `config.json` and **refuses** a config it
  cannot fully understand rather than defaulting missing fields.
- Incremental decode with a KV cache and carried recurrent state, verified to produce the
  same tokens as full recompute.
- Named memory presets (`--preset laptop|desktop|workstation|server|max`) derived from
  the measured memory ladder.
- `scripts/k3-doctor.sh`, reports whether a machine can run the model, which preset
  fits, and how fast its storage is.
- `scripts/download-model.sh`, fetches the checkpoint and verifies it byte-exactly
  against the published total, because a partial download produces wrong output silently.
- Test suite that runs entirely without model weights: op fixtures, expert cache,
  safetensors reader, config reader, and end-to-end oracle gates (teacher forcing,
  greedy decode, and incremental decode).
- CI: build matrix across GCC and Clang, warnings-as-errors, ASan and UBSan, Python and
  shell lint. Tokenizer parity is built and reported but CANNOT gate on a clean
  checkout, because it needs the vocabulary that ships with the model weights; run
  `make tok` locally against a downloaded checkpoint.

### Known limitations

- No chunked prefill, so long prompts are impractical despite a 32k context ceiling.
- Greedy decoding only; no chat template; no serving layer; no vision; CPU only.
