/* test_cache.c - the streaming expert cache, which nothing else tests.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *   Every op fixture and all three oracle gates drive the RESIDENT expert bank
 *   (K3MoeW.w1/w3/w2). The streaming path (K3MoeW.src -> K3Cache) is reached only when
 *   running the real 1.56 TB checkpoint. So the component the entire project depends on
 *   had no test at all, and it showed: a batch-prefetch bug that handed one slot to
 *   several experts simultaneously passed 22/22 fixtures and all three gates, and was
 *   caught only because the real model emitted token 65 where it should have emitted
 *   2494. A test that cannot fail is worse than no test; a path with no test is worse
 *   still.
 *
 * WHAT IS CHECKED
 *   1 IDENTITY      every expert read back through the cache is byte-identical to the
 *                   same expert read straight off disk. This is the check the aliasing
 *                   bug fails.
 *   2 EQUIVALENCE   the batch prefetch and the serial path return the SAME bytes. The
 *                   prefetch is an optimisation; if it changes a byte it is wrong.
 *   3 PRESSURE      with a cache far smaller than the working set, so eviction runs
 *                   constantly and slots are recycled aggressively. The bug only
 *                   appeared under pressure, because with a roomy cache pick_victim
 *                   returns genuinely free slots and the aliasing never happens.
 *   4 ACCOUNTING    requests, hits and prefetch_reads stay mutually consistent.
 *
 * usage: test_cache <fixture_dir> [n_experts]
 *        fixture_dir comes from tools/make_cache_fixture.py
