/* k3_st.h - safetensors reader for the real Kimi K3 checkpoint.
 *
 * The routed experts arrive as U8: packed MXFP4 nibbles plus E8M0 group scales. That
 * dtype, and the fact that an expert's six tensors form one contiguous run, are what
 * this reader is built around.
 *
 * FORMAT, verified against model-00002-of-000096.safetensors:
 *   [8 bytes little-endian N] [N bytes of JSON header] [tensor data]
 *   Each header entry: {"dtype": ..., "shape": [...], "data_offsets": [start, end]}
 *   data_offsets are relative to the END of the header, so the absolute file offset
 *   is 8 + N + start.
 *   The data region is fully contiguous with no gaps between tensors.
 *   That one shard held 5,404 tensors and 16.99 GB; the full model is 96 shards,
 *   497,220 tensors and 1.56 TB.
 *
 * WHY A HASH INDEX IS NOT OPTIONAL
 *   With 497,220 tensors, a linear scan per lookup is hopeless: at this tensor count it
 *   costs tens of seconds per token. Every expert load does six lookups (three matrices,
 *   each with a weight and a scale), and a single decode step touches 16 experts across
 *   92 layers, so lookups must be O(1).
 *
 * WHY pread AND NOT mmap
 *   Pages read into a buffer the engine owns never become file-backed mappings counted
 *   against the process, so peak RSS tracks what is actually resident rather than the
 *   whole 1.56 TB checkpoint. mmap would make the RSS figure meaningless at this size.

 *   O_DIRECT demands that the file offset, the length and the buffer address all be
 *   multiples of K3_ST_ALIGN. An expert run starts wherever the checkpoint put it, so
 *   the read is WIDENED outward to the enclosing aligned window and the caller is told
 *   where the payload actually begins inside buf. buf must therefore hold
 *   nbytes + 2*K3_ST_ALIGN and be page aligned (posix_memalign).
 *
 *   Worth it because a streamed expert is read once and evicted: the page cache can only
 *   copy it twice and push out something useful. Under a 32 GB cgroup cap the buffered
 *   path measured 1,247 MB/s on a disk that does 6,400.
 *
 * Returns payload bytes available, and sets *payload_off. Falls back to a buffered read
 * at offset 0 (setting *payload_off = 0) when O_DIRECT is not available. */
