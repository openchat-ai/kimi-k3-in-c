/* k3_run.c - run the REAL Kimi K3, all 93 layers, from the released checkpoint.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *   The full engine: safetensors index over 96 shards, resident trunk bound by name,
 *   routed experts streamed from disk through an LRU cache and multiplied straight out
 *   of MXFP4. Greedy decode. Token ids in, token ids out.
 *
 * MEMORY. The banner this program prints before allocating is a PLAN, not a measurement.
 *   It reports requested budgets rather than actual reservations, and in practice it
 *   OVERSTATES: across the 12-rung ladder in docs/data/ the planned total exceeded
 *   measured peak RSS by 0.13-1.84 GB, because both budgets round down to whole slots and
 *   that rounding outweighs the safetensors index it omits. Quote the "PEAK RSS" line
 *   instead, which comes from
 *   getrusage after the run. Fully resident, the weights are 108.81 GB of bf16 trunk plus
 *   4.70 GB of embed and lm_head, so 113.49 GB; streamed, the resident set is whatever
 *   budget is given, down to about 8.2 GB. The 1.45 TB of routed experts is never
 *   resident at any budget.
 *
 * THIS ENGINE IS I/O BOUND at small budgets and roughly balanced at large ones. The
 *   measured I/O share runs 40.9%-60.6% across the 12-rung ladder (docs/data/), dropping
 *   below 50% at 96 GB and above. The "I/O share" line printed at the end of every run
 *   reports it for that run. Going faster still means moving fewer bytes before it means
 *   computing less, which is why docs/TUNING.md is mostly about allocation.
 *
 * DECODE STRATEGY
 *   By default each step re-runs the whole prefix rather than carrying state forward.
 *   That is O(T^2), but it is the path the full-model oracle validates in
 *   tests/unit/k3_model.c. --incremental switches to prefill-then-one-token-at-a-time,
 *   carrying the KDA recurrent state and an MLA KV cache. GATE 3 of the tiny-model
 *   oracle requires it to produce the SAME tokens as full recompute, so the equivalence
 *   is tested rather than assumed. Context is limited by the MLA KV cache
 *   (~2.37 MB/position), not by array sizes; the engine computes the requirement up
 *   front and refuses the run if it will not fit.
 *
 * COMMAND LINE
 *   usage() below is the single source of truth for options and defaults; `k3 --help`
 *   prints it. It is not duplicated here, because a second copy is a second thing to
 *   keep correct and the copy is the one that goes stale.
