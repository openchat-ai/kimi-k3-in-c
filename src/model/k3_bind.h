/* k3_bind.h - bind real checkpoint tensors into the engine's weight structs.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SOLVES
 *   k3_st finds any tensor by name; k3.h describes what the kernels want. Nothing
 *   connected the two. This does, for one layer at a time, and it validates as it goes:
 *   every tensor's element count is checked against what the config implies BEFORE the
 *   bytes are read. A wrong assumption about a shape then fails loudly at load instead
 *   of silently producing a transposed or truncated matrix.
 *
 * NAMES, taken from the released checkpoint rather than guessed
 *   layers.L.input_layernorm.weight                       [hidden]
 *   layers.L.post_attention_layernorm.weight              [hidden]
 *   layers.L.self_attention_res_{norm,proj}.weight        [hidden], [1][hidden]
 *   layers.L.mlp_res_{norm,proj}.weight                   [hidden], [1][hidden]
 *   KDA: self_attn.{q,k,v,g}_proj, {q,k,v}_conv1d, f_a_proj, f_b_proj,
 *        b_proj, A_log, dt_bias, o_norm, o_proj
 *   MLA: self_attn.q_a_proj, q_a_layernorm, q_b_proj,
 *        kv_a_proj_with_mqa, kv_a_layernorm, kv_b_proj, o_proj, g_proj
 *   MoE: block_sparse_moe.gate.weight, gate.e_score_correction_bias,
 *        routed_expert_{down,up}_proj.weight, routed_expert_norm.weight,
 *        shared_experts.{gate,up,down}_proj.weight
 *   Dense (layer 0 only): mlp.{gate,up,down}_proj.weight
 *
 * TWO SHAPES THAT LOOK WRONG AND ARE NOT
 *   q_conv1d.weight ships as [H*D][1][conv_k], rank 3. The kernel wants [H*D][conv_k].
 *   Same bytes, same order; only the redundant middle axis differs, so the element
 *   count check passes and no repacking is needed.
 *
 *   A_log ships as [128] on a 96-head model. Elements 96..127 are exactly zero. It is
 *   PER HEAD, so the loader takes the first n_heads values. Reading all 128 as if they
 *   were per channel runs without complaint and gives a different model.
 *
 * MEMORY, AND THE TWO STORAGE CLASSES
 *   Large matrices keep the checkpoint's own bf16 bytes and are widened inside
 *   k3_mmw. Small vectors are widened here to fp32, because the kernels that consume
 *   them (k3_rmsnorm, k3_shortconv, k3_kda_decay, k3_router) index them ELEMENTWISE,
 *   where a silently wrong element type is not a crash but a different model.
 *
 *   The split is deliberate and cheap: the small vectors are 606,371,424 elements
 *   across the 93-layer trunk, so keeping them fp32 costs 2.43 GB, of which 1.18 GB is
 *   the router gate alone. In exchange the C type system enforces the distinction, and
 *   a mistake shows up as a compile error rather than as plausible output.
 *
 *   Measured totals: trunk 108.81 GB, embed and lm_head 4.70 GB, so 113.49 GB resident
 *   at bf16 against about 227 GB if everything were fp32. See k3.h for the breakdown.
