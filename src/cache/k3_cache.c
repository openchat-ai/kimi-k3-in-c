 * 17.55 MB, wait, repeat, 16 times per layer. NVMe needs depth to reach rated bandwidth,
 * so that pattern leaves most of the drive idle. This hands the whole set over at once.
 *
 * THREE PHASES, and the split is not cosmetic:
 *   1 SERIAL   resolve each miss and reserve it a slot. Slot allocation touches the LRU
 *              bookkeeping, which is shared mutable state and must not race.
 *   2 PARALLEL do the reads. Every read targets a distinct, already-assigned buffer and
 *              goes through pread, which takes its offset as an argument and so does not
 *              touch any shared file position. Nothing here is shared for writing.
 *   3 SERIAL   publish. A slot is registered to its key ONLY after its read succeeded.
 *
 * Phase 3 is where the danger was. Registering the key up front, then reading, would
 * leave a failed read with a slot that claims to hold an expert it does not -- and the
 * next request for that expert would count a HIT and multiply garbage. That exact bug
 * existed in the trunk ring and is why the order here is deliberate.
