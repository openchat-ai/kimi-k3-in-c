/* k3_cache.h - the streaming expert cache. This is the part the project exists for.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM, IN MEASURED NUMBERS
 *   Routed experts are 1.45 TB of the 1.56 TB checkpoint. A decode step selects top-16
 *   in each of 92 MoE layers, so 1,472 experts, 17,547,264 bytes each: 25.83 GB of
 *   weights per token if nothing is cached. At the ~1.2 GB/s a commodity NVMe device
 *   sustains on cold random reads of this size, that alone is about 21 s/token. The
 *   cache exists to reduce it, and its hit rate is the single number that decides
 *   whether the whole approach works. Measured hit rates by budget, with the hardware
 *   named, are in docs/PERFORMANCE.md.
 *
 * WHY THE CACHE HOLDS MXFP4 AND NOT FLOATS
 *   Dequantised, one expert is 132 MB rather than 17.55 MB. Caching floats would cut
 *   the number of resident experts by 7.5x for no benefit, because k3_matmul_mxfp4
 *   consumes the packed form directly and a matrix-vector product is memory-bound:
 *   reading a seventh of the bytes is faster, not slower.
 *
 * REPLACEMENT POLICY
 *   LRU with pinning. Two things make
 *   plain LRU safe here:
 *     - k3_moe fetches an expert and immediately uses it, so a slot handed out cannot
 *       be evicted before use as long as capacity exceeds topk. The constructor
 *       enforces that rather than trusting it.
 *     - The victim search is a linear scan over slots. At a few hundred slots that is a
 *       few hundred comparisons against a 17.55 MB read; it is not worth a heap.
 *
 * THE HISTOGRAM IS NOT INSTRUMENTATION
 *   Which experts are hot is not knowable in advance and is the input to any sensible
 *   pinning strategy. The cache counts every request per (layer, expert), 82,432
 *   counters costing 330 KB, so a real workload can be profiled and the hot set pinned
 *   permanently. Without that measurement, pinning is guesswork.
